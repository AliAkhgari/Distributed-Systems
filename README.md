# Distributed-Systems

This project offers a text formatting tool that processes input text, performing capitalization and ordinalization of numbers as its core operations. The tool is structured into two distinct phases: Phase 1 and Phase 2.

## Phase 1

The phase1 package capitalizes sentences and ordinalizes numbers in the input text.

## Phase 2

The phase2 package extends Phase 1 with concurrent text processing using Go routines.

**Go routines** are a fundamental feature of the Go programming language (Golang) that allows for concurrent execution of functions or methods. They are lightweight threads managed by the Go runtime, making executing functions concurrently and efficiently utilizing multicore processors easy.
